# Var_Catcher

Var catcher V1 By Steve Shambles April 2023

Requirements: None

Run var_catcher and load in a .py file, var_catcher will then create a function (as a text file) to print out your variables and their values any time or place you need it in your code.
copy and paste the def into your program and call the function "show_vars()" from anywhwere and as many times as you want in yoiur code for observation and debugging.
It's nothing code, but it can be a time saver, I find it useful anyway.

I am aware some IDE'S do something similar but I like to use a very basic and simple IDE, so there.
